Ses02F_script01_3_M030	sad	You know what I mean?  To show that, to bring that onto the Earth again, like some kind of monument and everyone would feel it standing behind him and it would make a difference to him.	3.0000	 4.0000	 5.0000
Ses02F_script01_3_M031	sad	Then I came back and it was incredible.  There was no meaning in it here.  The whole thing to them seemed like sort of a bus accident.  I went to work with Dad and that rat race again.	2.0000	 3.0000	 4.5000
Ses02F_script01_3_M032	sad	And I felt what you said, ashamed somehow 'cause nobody was changed at all.  It seemed to make suckers out of a lot of guys.  I felt wrong to be alive to open the new bank book, drive the new car, see the new refrigerator.	2.0000	 3.0000	 4.5000
Ses02F_script01_3_M033	sad	I mean, you can take those things out of a war, but when you drive that car, you've gotta know that it came out of the love a man can have for a man.  You've gotta be a little better because of it.	3.0000	 3.0000	 4.5000
Ses02F_script01_3_M034	sad	Because otherwise all you have is really loot and there's blood on it.  And I didn't want to take any of it.  And I guess that included you.	2.0000	 3.0000	 4.5000
Ses02F_script01_3_M035	xxx	I want you now Annie.	3.0000	 2.5000	 3.5000

Ses02M_impro04_F001	neu	You've been doing a lot of work for it, right?	3.0000	 2.3333	 2.3333
Ses02M_impro04_F002	neu	Right, so the fact you doing the best that you can is -	3.3333	 2.0000	 2.6667
Ses02M_impro04_F003	neu	you know you shouldn't give yourself a hard time for that, it's the best you can.	3.3333	 2.3333	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro04_F004	neu	Well, but you care about what you do, right?	2.6667	 3.0000	 2.3333
Ses02M_impro04_F005	neu	I understand that it's so frustrating but I know that you're here because you really want it you know and, and uh	3.3333	 2.3333	 2.6667
Ses02M_impro04_F006	neu	Well, I mean you're still here you've tried for this long so I think that says something all in itself.	3.3333	 2.3333	 2.3333
Ses02M_impro04_F007	neu	You are persistence. I mean that's important. that's	3.6667	 2.3333	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro04_F008	neu	Well, you're talented so keep that in mind, you know, you shouldn't give yourself too hard of a time.	3.3333	 2.3333	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro04_F009	sad	I'm sorry.	2.0000	 1.3333	 2.0000
Ses02M_impro04_F010	neu	That's- I mean. There are more factors then just whether you're good or not, you know what I mean like	3.0000	 2.0000	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro04_F011	neu	and the fact that you know there is always different types of things and what kind of people they want in the office and whether it's male or female or you know what I mean, like things are out of your control.	3.0000	 2.0000	 3.3333
Ses02M_impro04_F012	neu	So you should take that in consideration rather than giving yourself such a hard time.	3.0000	 1.6667	 3.6667
Ses02M_impro04_F013	xxx	It might be the latter I don't know because you're not the worst, I mean you're great, you very talented at what you do.	3.6667	 3.3333	 3.3333
Ses02M_impro04_F014	neu	You know and the fact you still here and still cooking, like it's good that you're thinking about it, that you're reconsidering.	3.3333	 2.3333	 3.3333
Ses02M_impro04_F015	neu	But like, just because you're considering why it's been so difficult doesn't mean you should just stop.	3.0000	 2.3333	 3.3333
Ses02M_impro04_F016	neu	Maybe you should take a little break from it, but I don't think you should stop.	3.0000	 2.6667	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro04_F017	xxx	Get out of town or something, I mean you need - you need to clear your head 'cause you seem like you're really frustrated about it. I mean you need to like, be excited about you're doing, rather than, you know upset.	3.3333	 2.3333	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro04_M000	fru	Uhm, I don't know	1.6667	 3.0000	 2.6667
Ses02M_impro04_M001	fru	I don't know what I'm going to do about this; I mean	2.0000	 3.0000	 2.0000
Ses02M_impro04_M002	fru	I have got to get a job, you know? Like-	2.3333	 3.6667	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro04_M003	fru	Well, yea you know, I get my resumes and I mean I-	3.0000	 3.0000	 2.6667
Ses02M_impro04_M004	fru	I go out all the places I can, every place that'll give an interview you know.	2.3333	 3.3333	 2.6667
Ses02M_impro04_M005	fru	But it's been so long, like what - what am I - what am I waiting -- I should probably just do something else, or	2.0000	 4.0000	 2.3333
Ses02M_impro04_M006	fru	I don't know, I mean why - why	2.0000	 3.0000	 2.6667
Ses02M_impro04_M007	fru	Yea, but it's - it's almost like it's not worth it you know, if I'm going to waste to have my life like trying to get a job, I mean once I actually do get the job it's like oh, retirement or something. I don't know, you know.	2.0000	 3.6667	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro04_M008	xxx	Well, and that's what I begin to question after a while is maybe I just don't want it, maybe it's not even worth it, you know, like	2.3333	 2.3333	 2.6667
Ses02M_impro04_M009	fru	I don't even know if it's going to be worth it because I can't break myself in, you know like I can't - can't even get a foot in the door you know.	2.3333	 3.6667	 2.6667
Ses02M_impro04_M010	fru	Yea, it says I'm stupid enough to be trying this long and not move on somewhere else.	2.3333	 3.3333	 3.3333
Ses02M_impro04_M011	fru	I mean, I can't- I can't be persistent forever, you know, you can't not have a job forever, you know, I've got- I've got to do something, I've got to make money and get food on the table.	2.0000	 3.0000	 3.3333
Ses02M_impro04_M012	fru	I mean, maybe I'm not, you know. I don't have a job. Maybe - maybe I'm not as good as-as I thought I was and	3.0000	 3.0000	 2.0000
Ses02M_impro04_M013	fru	I just got a whole skewed opinion on just how this is supposed to work out and	2.3333	 3.0000	 2.6667
Ses02M_impro04_M014	sad	I don't know, it's just not, I don't know - I don't know what to do really, you know, I'm just thinking	2.3333	 2.3333	 2.3333
Ses02M_impro04_M015	fru	maybe - maybe take up painting, I don't know, you know.	3.0000	 2.6667	 2.0000
Ses02M_impro04_M016	fru	Do something that I don't have to go out and do something, stay at home, I don't know.	3.3333	 3.6667	 2.3333
Ses02M_impro04_M017	fru	Seems like the only option at this point because obviously the outer world has just rejected me of all possible employment.	2.6667	 3.6667	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro04_M018	fru	I know, but I mean- if that's the - you know, I'm either like the worst at this or just the most unlucky person on the planet I mean this doesn't	2.3333	 3.3333	 2.6667
Ses02M_impro04_M019	ang	this doesn't happen to a normal person.	2.0000	 3.3333	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro04_M020	fru	I mean, I don't know, I don't see - I don't see any other way - any other way around it right now.	2.0000	 2.3333	 2.6667
Ses02M_impro04_M021	xxx	What am I going to do on a break?	2.0000	 2.0000	 2.0000

Ses02M_impro05_F001	neu	Oh, did you check? Did you make sure as it went around the second time that it-	3.5000	 3.0000	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro05_F002	neu	Okay. Well, um- the f.	3.0000	 2.5000	 2.5000
Ses02M_impro05_F003	neu	Actually I'm looking here at the information, the flight that you were on we had some trouble with some of the baggage, it looks like a few peoples' bags didn't make it through. Um, so-	3.0000	 3.0000	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro05_F004	neu	Well, you can fill out this paperwork um- and if for some reason it shows up, we can bring it to you, but-	3.0000	 3.0000	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro05_F005	neu	Well, sometimes it's just late baggage or misplaced baggage and it comes out but it seems to be here and just I'm reading off of this that	2.5000	 3.0000	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro05_F006	neu	Uh- it didn't make it into the second plane so it looks like there - they don't actually know what happened to it.	2.5000	 3.0000	 3.5000
Ses02M_impro05_F007	neu	Um, well, sometimes there is just difficulties with loading on to the plane. Uh- There can be a theft or uh- some sort of you know mishap with a cart or something.	2.5000	 3.0000	 3.5000
Ses02M_impro05_F008	neu	I- I- I understand, but um.	3.0000	 2.5000	 2.5000

Ses02M_impro05_F010	neu	Right.	3.0000	 2.5000	 2.5000
Ses02M_impro05_F011	neu	I understand that. Um- So I'm going to put down here that you looking for your baggage, but we actually can't, uh this bag is likely not going to show up so what we're going to do-	2.0000	 3.0000	 3.5000
Ses02M_impro05_F012	neu	Sometimes it gets stolen, sometimes it gets misplaced on another plane and	2.5000	 3.0000	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro05_F013	neu	they - they, it gets shipped to somewhere else and then it's stuck somewhere and then we have no way of tracking that.	2.5000	 3.0000	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro05_F014	neu	So we'll- what we'll do	2.5000	 2.5000	 2.5000
Ses02M_impro05_F015	neu	Right. Like I said sometimes a theft and things happen like that but we are willing to reim-reimburse you.	3.0000	 3.0000	 3.5000
Ses02M_impro05_F016	neu	Um, so.	3.0000	 2.5000	 2.5000
Ses02M_impro05_F017	neu	We have very tight security but we -uh- there are times when we just can't uh make sure there aren't absolutely no human error, you know	2.5000	 3.0000	 2.5000
Ses02M_impro05_F018	neu	I'm sorry there is no guarantee on baggage.	2.0000	 2.5000	 3.0000

Ses02M_impro05_F023	neu	Well, it's- it's just sort of help with the fact uh that you lost some of your possessions and we rather do that than-	2.5000	 3.5000	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro05_F024	neu	The airline can't afford to give you everything that is in that suitcase. and so-	2.5000	 3.0000	 3.0000
Ses02M_impro05_F025	neu	Well because lots of people get their baggage lost and we don't want to have false claims or anything like that so we have	2.5000	 3.0000	 3.5000
Ses02M_impro05_F026	neu	we can give you fifty dollar to sort of make up for it, to compensate, and we can definitely let you know if it shows up but likely, more than likely-	2.5000	 3.0000	 3.5000

Ses05F_impro05_M013	fru	Well, obviously, that wasn't me, so I'm going to have to ask you the same questions they asked you just so we can get to the same point.	3.0000	 2.5000	 4.0000
Ses05F_impro05_M014	neu	All right?  Now, um- it's green, travel bag, you couldn't find it.  And was there something important in it that you need it?	3.0000	 3.0000	 3.5000
Ses05F_impro05_M015	neu	Sentimental value.	3.0000	 2.5000	 3.0000
Ses05F_impro05_M016	neu	Right.  Well, I don't know what to tell you. Um- What I can offer you is a fifty dollar voucher on your next flight.	2.5000	 3.0000	 3.5000

Ses05F_impro05_M026	fru	That's what the cost of the ticket was for.	3.0000	 2.5000	 3.0000
Ses05F_impro05_M027	fru	Ma'am, international flights are not cheap and there's many reasons for that.  It does not have solely to do with your baggage or-	2.5000	 3.0000	 3.5000
Ses05F_impro05_M028	fru	Right. Yes, ma'am.	3.0000	 2.5000	 2.5000
Ses05F_impro05_M029	fru	Right, and also if you'll read the fine print of your agreement you'll see that while we do bear some responsibility for lost luggage, it is a fifty dollar voucher.	2.5000	 3.0000	 4.0000
Ses05F_impro05_M030	neu	Well, I understand that.  Did you buy flight insurance?	3.0000	 3.0000	 3.0000

Ses05F_impro05_M032	neu	Well, it's like any kind of insurance.  You don't-when you get it, then you get more. You know, Like if you--	3.0000	 3.5000	 4.0000
Ses05F_impro05_M033	neu	Well, of course not because you've got your backpack with you the whole time.  Now, if you--you said this was a travel bag.  Why weren't you carrying it on if it was so important?	2.0000	 3.0000	 4.0000
Ses05F_impro05_M034	neu	Uh, so it was really heavy.	3.0000	 3.0000	 3.0000
Ses05F_impro05_M035	fru	Well, you know what, it could still turn up, but until then I can offer you this fifty dollar voucher.	3.0000	 3.0000	 3.5000
Ses05F_impro05_M036	neu	I'm sorry, ma'am, there's nothing else I can do.  My hands are really tied here.  I really wish there was something else I could do for you.	2.5000	 3.0000	 3.5000
Ses05F_impro05_M037	neu	Well I don't know why you wouldn't believe that.	2.5000	 3.0000	 2.5000

Ses05F_impro05_M042	xxx	I've gone into the computer.  I told you exactly what I can see in the computer that your luggage did arrive here.	2.5000	 3.0000	 3.5000
Ses05F_impro05_M043	fru	Well, you can take my stinking fifty dollar voucher and go home and wait and see if your luggage turns up. And if it does, then we'll deliver it to you.	3.0000	 3.0000	 4.0000
Ses05F_impro05_M044	fru	I have no guarantee, absolutely not.	3.0000	 3.0000	 3.0000
Ses05F_impro05_M045	fru	How can I guarantee finding your luggage when it's lost?	2.5000	 2.5000	 3.5000
Ses05F_impro05_M046	fru	Right, well, when you're at home and you lose something, do you guarantee that you're going to find it later on?	3.0000	 3.0000	 3.5000
Ses05F_impro05_M047	fru	Well, it sounds to me like you're being ridiculous	2.5000	 3.0000	 3.5000
Ses05F_impro05_M048	neu	Right.	3.0000	 3.0000	 2.5000
Ses05F_impro05_M049	fru	I understand that, ma'am, but things get lost.  There's nothing I can do about that.  Things happen.  Accidents happen.	2.5000	 3.5000	 4.5000
Ses05F_impro05_M050	neu	And while I really would love to be able to hand you your bag right now, obviously I can't do that.	2.5000	 3.5000	 4.0000

Ses05M_script03_2_M012	xxx	No particular reason.  Besides, they were little ones.	3.0000	 3.0000	 3.5000
Ses05M_script03_2_M013	xxx	You can hardly say- You can hardly call three little liquor glasses of brandy for the entire evening going on and on.	2.0000	 3.5000	 4.0000
Ses05M_script03_2_M014	xxx	You needn't be so grand simply because you don't happen to want me at the moment.	1.5000	 3.5000	 4.0000

Ses05M_script03_2_M029	ang	Oh, really?  How about a child of three, or child of six, what about a child of nine?	2.0000	 4.5000	 4.5000
Ses05M_script03_2_M030	ang	You know, we could get a really good debate going on about this.  You know intemperate tots.	2.0000	 5.0000	 4.5000
